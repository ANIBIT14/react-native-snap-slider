# @elselabs/react-native-snap-slider
forked from https://github.com/franfran/react-native-snap-slider

Forked the project because it was un-maintained and did not support newer versions of React & React-Native.

## Differences
- Using https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-slider instead of the deprecated Slider component inside react-native.
- Built using `React.Component` instead of `create-react-class` package.

## Setup
```
npm i -S @elselabs/react-native-snap-slider
```
